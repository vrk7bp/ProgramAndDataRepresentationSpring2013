======================================

Code from CS 2150 (UVa), C++

This file holds three of the more significant projects from my first C++ focused class. The class focused on data
structures and algorithms. The three programs are a lab focused on two tree structures, a brute force solution to
the traveling sales person problem, and a program that focuses on the stack data structure.
